This script pulls and wrangles American Community Survey (ACS) data into a dataset for assessing the change in the populations of three aggregated categories of income-to-poverty level over time, specifically here from 2005 to 2022.
The script here aggregates the income-to-poverty ratio variable into several possible categorical frameworks.
 
The ones used in the analysis in the "Montgomery County's Changing Income Trends and Repositioning for Shared Prosperity" Research Brief are listed here with corresponding dataset code, and descriptive name used in the research brief: 

# ACS Aggregate Variable                 Dataset Code        Descriptive Name 
# under 3X poverty level                    u300                Low-Income
# Above 3X and below 5X poverty level       x300to499           Middle-Income
# 5X poverty level and above                x500plus            High-Income
